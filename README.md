# CodeChef Scripts | ![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/PYTH%203.6-(Python%203.6)-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)

I mainly use these for quickly prototyping competetive programming questions.

### [template.py](template.py)

My CodeChef template for PYTH 3.6 (Python 3.6).
Works with smallest as well as largest inputs and outputs possible in python.
Yeilds lower defaut overhead when running than a regular script.


### [monitor.py](monitor.py)

Hot-reloader script for quick reloading of the scripts without switching your editor.

#### Usage

```bash
python monitor.py [script_name.py]
```

Methods to reload -

1. Press `r`.
2. Save your script file on your editor.
3. Save your input file on your editor.

#### Note - Entire script is restarted unlike module reloading.
